This is a not-yet-working Opera extension I'm using to experiment with
OAuth in Javascript.

It doesn't really work yet, but at least the Javascript used to make
the OAuth requests works now (see oauthtestget.js for GET requests and
oauthtest.js for POST requests), so you can have a look at the code
and see how to adapt it for your own purposes.
