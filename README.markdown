Show Filtered Content
=====================

[Show Filtered Content](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/show-filtered-content/)
is a very simple
[Opera extension](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/) that
shows how to use OAuth (and the Opera Link API) from Javascript. It
connects to the Opera Link API to get your "Content Blocker" URLs and
it shows of many elements are blocked in the current page (eg. if
you're wondering if there's anything missing on the page because it's
blocked, you can click on the pop-up and find out).

Check these links for more information on the Opera Link API:

* [Official API documentation](http://www.opera.com/docs/apis/linkrest/)
* [Introducing the Opera Link API](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introducing-the-opera-link-api/)
* [Building your first Link API application](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/building-your-first-link-api-application/)

For the OAuth part, I'm using this [Javascript OAuth library](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/).
